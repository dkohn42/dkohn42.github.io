                <h4>Robby the Robot - Q-Learning</h4>
                Robby learns how to efficiently pick up cans through a type a reinforcement learning called Q-Learning. 
                The robot preceives the state of the world around and maps those states to actions in a Q-table. The 
                action of 'picking up a can' when the robot's state is 'standing on a can' provides a reward. Over 
                millions of trials played, these rewards are back-filled through the table to provide the robot with a
                strategy for solving the problem.

                <h4>Blackjack - Q-Learning</h4>
                This is another Q-Learning project, but with a larger state-space. The goal in this project
                is for the AI to learn to play Blackjack against a dealer. At first the AI is playing completely
                randomly. As it wins the Q-table begins to fill with back-propogated rewards. Eventually, a
                the performance of the AI begins to approach a net-zero win loss ratio. Since the odds of
                winning/losing in Blackjack is around 50/50, this is the best outcome without making a card
                counting AI. The image left or above shows a final strategy Q-table learned by the AI.

                <h4>IRC Chat - Client and Server - RFC Project</h4>
                For this project, I created an IRC Chat RFC. The protocol standardized communication between
                a client and server for logins, creating/joining a chat room, and sending a message. The client
                program, shown in the image, we created to demonstrate the RFC was complete and provided all of
                the required functionality. The client was written using Python and utilized Websockets and
                JSON to communicate with the server.

              <h4>Ethereum Chess - Ethereum Smart Contract Development</h4>
              Using the Ropsten Ethereum Test Blockchain, I deployed a smart contract, written with Vyper. The 
              smart contract accepted an Ethereum token from each player and stored it for the duration of 
              the game as well as storing the state of the chess game, checking valid move, and 'check' 
              conditions. Each player interacted with the Ethereum blockchain to check and update their next
              move. Once a player was unable to move, or failed to make a move, for 24 hours, then the winner
              could claim their prize. An html page and javascript were used to interact with the smart contract
              on the blockchain. Using the real Ethereum blockchain to play this would cost about 0.01 ETH, or 
              $20, per move.
