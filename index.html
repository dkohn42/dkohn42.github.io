        <p class="text">My name is Darin Kohn. I am a CS graduate student at PSU. My
           BA was in Math and Science Education and I spent the last 7
           years teaching middle school Science. I also ran an after
           school Coding Club for students. Before that I served nine
           years in the US Navy on board nuclear submarines. I have two
           sons who are currently enjoying their Spring Break while I'm doing homework
